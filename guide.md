### WARNING
IF YOU DISCONNECT THE MICRO USB FROM YOUR CONSOLE WHILE HAKCHI IS INSTALLING THE CUSTOM KERNEL, YOU MAY PERMANENTLY BRICK YOUR CONSOLE.
PROCEED CAREFULLY.

## 1. installing the custom kernel
You will need Hakchi to install the custom kernel. Get it [here](https://github.com/teamshinkansen/hakchi2-ce/releases/).

1. Install hakchi on your computer.

2. Open hakchi.

3. Select the console and the correct region.
    If it does not ask for your console's model and region, select these manually from the drop-down menu on the top-left.

4. Now click the drop-down menu called "Kernel" on the top and select "Install / Repair".

5. Follow the instructions that appear on screen.

6. Wait for hakchi to install the custom kernel.
    If your console needs a lot of time to reboot, it may be frozen.
    Wait some more time, and if it still frozen on the hakchi booting screen, go back to step 4.

If your console is on the main menu, the custom kernel was succesfully installed!
Now we are ready to install games.
