##### A noob-proof guide to anyone who wants to install games on their NES/SNES classic!
This guide will give you instructions on how to mod your NES/SNES classic!
## Premission: Risks
This guide will install a custom kernel, a modified version of the mini's original kernel.
You should be fully sure when you install a custom kernel, since there is no turning back.

IF YOU DISCONNECT THE MICRO USB FROM YOUR CONSOLE WHILE HAKCHI IS INSTALLING THE CUSTOM KERNEL, YOU MAY PERMANENTLY BRICK YOUR CONSOLE.
PROCEED CAREFULLY.

###### The instrucions in this guide are the same for NES classic and SNES classic.

## 1. installing the custom kernel
You will need Hakchi to install the custom kernel. Get it [here](https://github.com/teamshinkansen/hakchi2-ce/releases/).

1. Install hakchi on your computer.

2. Open hakchi.

3. Select the console and the correct region.
    If it does not ask you directly for your console's model and region, select these manually from the drop-down menu on the top-left.

4. Click the drop-down menu called "Kernel" on the top and select "Install / Repair".

5. Follow the instructions that appear on screen.

6. Wait for hakchi to install the custom kernel.
    If your console needs a lot of time to reboot, it may be frozen.
    Wait some more time, and if it still frozen on the hakchi booting screen, go back to step 4.

If your console boots up on the main menu, and the hakchi booting screen has appeared, the custom kernel was succesfully installed!
Now we are ready to install games.

## 2. installing ROMs
Now, you will need roms to install.
NES roms have the .nes extension,
SNES roms have either the .smc extension or the .sfc extension.
    You can find loads of NES roms [here](https://www.emulatorgames.net/roms/nintendo/),
    and as much SNES roms [here](https://www.emulatorgames.net/roms/super-nintendo/).
######     please let me know if i gave you not trustable websites.

1. Click on the "Add more games..." button on the bottom left.
    You can jump step 2 by dragging and dropping the ROM file on the hakchi window on your PC.

2. Select the ROMs on the window that pops up, then click open.
    Keep in mind that you can select more roms at once.

3. Finally, click "Syncronize selected games with mini".
    Hakchi may ask you if you have installed the custom kernel. If you did, click Yes.
    If you didn't install the custom kernel, go back to part 1.

4. Follow the instructions on screen.

5. Wait for Hakchi to finish the installation.

At this point, Hakchi should have installed the ROMs on your console.
We will now check if the games are correctly installed.

6. Make sure your console is on.
    If it is not, turn it on.

7. A new item in the main menu called "More games..." should have appeared among the other built-in games. Open it.
    If you can't find that item, check the checkbox on Hakchi on your PC, then go back to step 3.

###### Optional: Try opening all of the games you installed. If they run correctly, good.

#### Congrats! your console now has custom games!
